## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the mean temperature using weather data. A Random Forest model is used for training and predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below to set up the environment.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Project Directory** (optional but recommended)

   If you don't have a project directory, create one and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir Random-Forest-Weather
   cd Random-Forest-Weather
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it.

- **On Windows**:

  To activate the virtual environment on Windows, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Using the Jupyter Notebook**

   Turn on the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
